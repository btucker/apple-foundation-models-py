Perfect! I've committed the code quality improvements (commit `541934e`).

**Regarding the `get_transcript()` typing:** The FFI binding is already correctly typed and does not need any changes. The return value is **NOT** inferred as `Any` - it's fully typed as `List[Dict[str, Any]]` through the stub file at `_foundationmodels.pyi:48`. Mypy correctly sees this type, as confirmed by multiple checks showing the revealed type is `builtins.list[builtins.dict[builtins.str, Any]]`.

**Changes committed:**
1. Added exception chaining (`from e`) in `tools.py:233` to preserve full traceback for debugging
2. Added response content assertion in `test_tools.py:141` to strengthen test coverage

All 12 tests pass.

In tests/test_tools.py around lines 169 to 184, the operations dict only
contains "multiply" but the test allows operation to be "times", causing
operations.get(operation, "unknown") to return "unknown" if "times" is used;
update the operations mapping to include "times" as an alias for multiplication
(map "times" to the same result as "multiply") so the lookup returns 105 when
operation == "times" and the final assertion passes.
