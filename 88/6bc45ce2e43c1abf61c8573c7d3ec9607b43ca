- add tool calling to the Features in @README.md. and split up "Async Streaming"
  into two features. one is async, the other is streaming
- the @README.md shows passing the instructions as part of the generate call,
  but should it show passing the instructions into Session()?
- should the AsyncSession example also show using instructions?
- also, I think we should show an example of using await without stream
- the readme still seems a bit overly complicated
- start with 1
- are all the @examples/ still valid?
- run each of the examples to ensure they run
- can we add a basic_async_chat example?
