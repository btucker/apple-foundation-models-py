- I ran `uv pip install -e .` but then why is this happening?
- sorry, please continue
- none of these resolved the issue: ➜  apple-foundation-models-py git:(main) ✗
  pytest tests/test_integration.py
- I'm not seeing much of any assertions in @tests/test_integration.py
- check that the rest of all the test files are actually asserting what they are
  testing
- do you notice anything else to cleanup?
