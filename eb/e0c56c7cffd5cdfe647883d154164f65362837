I'll help you add a GitHub workflow for PyPI publishing. Let me first explore the project structure to understand the current setup.

Now I'll create a GitHub workflow for PyPI publishing. Since this package requires Swift compilation and macOS-specific frameworks, the workflow will use macOS runners.

Perfect! I've created a GitHub workflow for PyPI publishing at `.github/workflows/publish-to-pypi.yml:1`.

## What the workflow does:

1. **Triggers**: Runs automatically when you publish a GitHub release, or can be manually triggered
2. **Environment**: Uses macOS runners (required for Swift compilation and FoundationModels framework)
3. **Build process**:
   - Sets up Python 3.11
   - Installs Cython and build dependencies
   - Builds the package (which triggers Swift dylib compilation via your custom setup.py)
   - Creates both sdist and wheel distributions
4. **Publishing**: Uses PyPI's trusted publishing with OIDC tokens (more secure than API tokens)

## Setup required:

Before this workflow can publish to PyPI, you need to configure trusted publishing:

1. Go to https://pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/
2. Add a new publisher with these settings:
   - **PyPI Project Name**: `apple-foundation-models`
   - **Owner**: `btucker`
   - **Repository name**: `apple-foundation-models-py`
   - **Workflow name**: `publish-to-pypi.yml`
   - **Environment name**: (leave empty)

## To publish a release:

1. Update the version in `pyproject.toml:7`
2. Create a git tag: `git tag v0.1.0 && git push origin v0.1.0`
3. Create a GitHub release from that tag
4. The workflow will automatically build and publish to PyPI

The workflow includes verification steps to check the build artifacts before publishing.
