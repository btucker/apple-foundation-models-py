Perfect! I've committed the fix (commit `5e06c11`). The issue was that the operations dictionary only mapped "multiply" to the multiplication result, but the test assertion allowed the operation to be either "multiply" or "times".

**The fix:** Added `"times": x * y` to the operations dict so that if the AI model uses "times" instead of "multiply", the calculation will still return 105 instead of "unknown", ensuring the final assertion passes.

All 12 tests pass.

In tests/test_tools.py around line 135 the test assigns response =
session.generate(...) but never asserts on it; add an assertion that validates
the response contains the expected search result text or structure (for example
check response is not empty and includes the word "authentication" or the
expected summary/marker used by the search results); update the test to assert
the correct type/fields on response (e.g., response is a string or dict and
contains the expected keys/substring) so the test fails if the search
functionality returns nothing or unexpected content.

I can see there's already an assertion on line 141 (from a previous commit), but let me enhance it to be more comprehensive and explicit about validating the response type and content:
