Perfect! The commit was successful. Here's what was committed:

**Commit:** `b396e8e` - "fix: include libfoundation_models.dylib in wheels and build for multiple Python versions"

**Files changed:**
- `.github/workflows/publish-to-pypi.yml` - Multi-Python wheel builds with dylib verification
- `pyproject.toml` - Added `*.dylib` to package data
- `setup.py` - Copies dylib to package directory during build

**Note:** `uv.lock` has a minor change (version number update) but I left it uncommitted. You can commit it separately if needed, or just leave it for now.

The changes are now ready to push. When you create a new release, the GitHub Actions workflow will:
1. Build wheels for Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13
2. Verify each wheel contains `libfoundation_models.dylib`
3. Build a source distribution
4. Publish everything to PyPI

Would you like to push this to GitHub?
