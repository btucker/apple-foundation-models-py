- it seems like there's a bunch of overlap/duplication between clients &
  sessions
- yes, please refactor
- Do we even need the client at all? should we just start at either Session or
  AsyncSession?
- yes, do this
- why do we still have client.py & async_client.py?
- what about all the associated tests?
- now update @README.md
- ERROR tests/test_tools.py - NameError: name 'Client' is not defined
