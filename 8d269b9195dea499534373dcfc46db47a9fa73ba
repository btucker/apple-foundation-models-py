- take out the references to OpenAI in @README.md
- the @session.tool decorator seems like the wrong name, it's not really related
  to the @session.
- Isn't there a way to have the tool description in a comment?
- If we use the docstring, then couldn't we pass the tools in as a parameter to
  generate and skip the decorator?
- let's do this and change the underlying implementation
- the concept of recreating the session concerns me. Look at the apple
  foundation models SDK docs, does it have a better way to do this?
- I'm seeing a bunch of stuff left in the code that's "not used in simplified
  interface." we should get rid of all that
- yes, let's remove them
- do we have stubs that should be removed?
- let's remove them all
- take we try to make that test less flaky?
