- great, please proceed with that implementation.
- test it
- great! can we now remove all the artifacts leftover from when we were going to
  use libai?
- are you certain there's nothing left anywhere about libai?
- give credit for inspiration to libai & the nodejs bridge we looked at in the
  README
- why isn't it Swift -> CFFI -> Cython -> Python?
- search the web to confirm this is the best approach for linking Swift with
  python
- why do we need both cython & cffi?
- yes, but can we rename the Cython not to be libai since we're not using libai.
  let's rename our whole package to apple-foundation-models-py
- does the name @foundationmodels/swift/apple_ai.swift make sense? or should we
  change that?
- yes, option 2
- do we need @scripts/build_swift.sh? could that just be in setup.py?
- 1
- I think we can remove the script
- can we move @test_full.py into a more canonical location? Also what's our
  current test coverage?
- it is available
